## Impacts of File Upload Vulnerabilities

File upload vulnerabilities can have severe consequences for a web application and its server:

1. **Web-shell Upload**: Attackers upload malicious scripts (e.g., `.php`, `.asp`) to execute arbitrary code, gaining unauthorized access.
2. **Reverse Shell Upload**: Malicious files establish a reverse connection to the attacker's machine, enabling persistent remote access.
3. **Remote Control**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to control the server and manipulate resources.
4. **Security Loss**: Compromises server integrity, confidentiality, and availability, exposing sensitive data.
5. **Financial Loss**: Breaches may lead to downtime, data theft, or ransomware, causing financial damage.
6. **File Overwrite**: Malicious files can overwrite critical system files, disrupting functionality.

## First Step: Information Gathering

To exploit file upload vulnerabilities, attackers gather key information:

1. **Server Version and Name**: Identify the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and version to uncover vulnerabilities.
2. **Which Shell?**: Determine if a web-shell or reverse shell is feasible based on server configuration.
3. **Limitations**: Understand file size limits, upload quotas, or directory permissions.
4. **Web Shell or Reverse Shell**: Choose based on attack goals (direct execution vs. persistent access).
5. **Allowed Extensions**: Identify permitted file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`) and restrictions.

Additional reconnaissance may involve brute-forcing directories to locate upload paths.

## File Upload Vulnerabilities: Filtering Mechanisms

Web applications use client-side and server-side filtering to restrict uploads. Attackers analyze these for weaknesses.

### Client-Side Filtering

- **Description**: Filtering occurs in the browser (e.g., via JavaScript) before file upload.
- **Bypass Techniques**:
  1. **Method 1: Modify Source Code**
     - Inspect source code to locate JavaScript validation.
     - Disable/modify filtering code using browser developer tools.
     - Upload malicious file (e.g., `malicious.php`) and access it (e.g., `/uploads/malicious.php`).
  2. **Method 2: Intercept HTTP Request**
     - Use Burp Suite to intercept the upload request.
     - Remove/modify JavaScript validation (e.g., delete `.js` checks).
     - Forward the modified request, upload the file, and access it.

### Server-Side Filtering

- **Description**: Validation occurs on the server after upload, focusing on extensions, MIME types, content types, or size.
- **Types**:
  1. **Extension Filtering**:
     - **Blacklist Filtering**: Blocks extensions like `.php`, `.phtml`. Bypassed with alternate extensions (e.g., `.php5`, `.pht`) or double extensions (e.g., `file.jpg.php`).
     - **Whitelist Filtering**: Allows only specific extensions (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`). Exploited via misconfigurations or malicious content in allowed files.
  2. **MIME-Type Filtering**:
     - Validates file MIME type (e.g., `image/jpeg`) based on magic bytes.
     - **Bypass Technique**:
       - Intercept request to identify allowed MIME types/extensions.
       - Collect magic bytes for allowed files (e.g., `FF D8 FF` for JPEG).
       - Prepend allowed magic bytes to a malicious file (e.g., PHP web-shell with `GIF89a`).
       - Upload and access the file.

  3. **Content-Type Filtering**:
     - Checks `Content-Type` header (e.g., `image/jpeg`). Modify header to match allowed type.
  4. **File Length Filtering**:
     - Restricts file size. Bypassed with small malicious files or chunked uploads.

## Types of File Upload Vulnerabilities

1. **Extension-Based Vulnerabilities**:
   - Weak extension validation allows executable scripts (e.g., `.php`, `.asp`).
   - **Example**: Upload `shell.php` disguised as `shell.jpg.php`.

2. **MIME Type-Based Vulnerabilities**:
   - Weak MIME type validation allows malicious files with forged MIME types.
   - **Example**: Change MIME type of a PHP file to `image/jpeg`.

3. **File Size-Based Vulnerabilities**:
   - Unenforced size limits allow large files to overwhelm the server.
   - **Example**: Upload a massive file to cause a denial-of-service (DoS).

4. **Double Extension-Based Vulnerabilities**:
   - Weak validation allows double extensions (e.g., `file.png.php`).
   - **Example**: Apache may execute `file.jpg.php` as PHP if misconfigured.

5. **Tampering with HTTP Requests**:
   - Modify request parameters (e.g., `Content-Type`, `filename`) to bypass validation.
   - **Example**: Change `filename="shell.php"` to `filename="shell.jpg"`.

6. **Bypassing Client-Side and Server-Side Validation**:
   - Weak validation allows manipulation of file metadata to upload malicious files.

## Example: Bypassing MIME-Type Filtering

- **Analysis**:
  - File named `123.php` with `Content-Type: image/jpg` to bypass MIME validation.
  - Starts with `GIF89a` (GIF magic bytes) followed by PHP code (`<?php eval($_GET["cmd"]);?>`).
  - Allows a web-shell disguised as an image, executable if the server misinterprets it.

- **Steps**:
  1. Intercept upload request with Burp Suite.
  2. Modify `Content-Type` to an allowed type (e.g., `image/jpg`).
  3. Prepend valid magic bytes (e.g., `GIF89a`) to malicious PHP code.
  4. Upload and access via upload directory (e.g., `/uploads/123.php?cmd=whoami`).


## Tools for Testing File Upload Vulnerabilities

- **Burp Suite**: Intercept and modify HTTP requests.
- **Dirb/Gobuster**: Brute-force directories to locate upload paths.
- **Metasploit**: Craft and test web/reverse shells.
- **File Command (Linux)**: Analyze magic bytes for crafting files.

## Additional Notes

- **Directory Brute-Forcing**: Use tools like `dirb` or `gobuster` to find upload directories (e.g., `/uploads/`).
- **Double Extension Attacks**: Test by appending executable extensions (e.g., `file.jpg.php`).
- **Magic Bytes**:
  - JPEG: `FF D8 FF`
  - PNG: `89 50 4E 47`
  - GIF: `47 49 46 38 39 61` (GIF89a)
  - PDF: `25 50 44 46` (%PDF)


## Mitigation Strategies

To prevent file upload vulnerabilities:

1. **Strict Server-Side Validation**:
   - Use whitelists for extensions and MIME types.
   - Verify file content with magic bytes, not just headers.
   - Block executable extensions (e.g., `.php`, `.asp`).

2. **File Storage Best Practices**:
   - Store files outside the web root (e.g., `/var/uploads`).
   - Use randomized filenames.
   - Disable execution permissions in upload directories.

3. **MIME-Type and Content Validation**:
   - Use server-side libraries (e.g., `libmagic` in PHP).
   - Reprocess files (e.g., re-save images) to strip malicious code.

4. **File Size Limits**:
   - Enforce strict size limits to prevent DoS.
   - Validate size on both client and server sides.

5. **Secure HTTP Request Handling**:
   - Sanitize request parameters (e.g., `filename`, `Content-Type`).
   - Use secure file upload libraries.

6. **Content Security Policies (CSP)**:
   - Restrict execution of uploaded files.
   - Disable inline scripts and enforce MIME-type checks.

7. **Directory Brute-Force Protection**:
   - Restrict directory indexing and access.
   - Use `.htaccess` to deny direct access to uploaded files.
