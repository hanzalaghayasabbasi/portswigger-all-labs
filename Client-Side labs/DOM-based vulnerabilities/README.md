## What is the DOM?

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is the browser’s internal representation of a web page. It is a tree-like structure composed of all the HTML elements on the page.

JavaScript can access and manipulate the DOM, changing the page's structure, style, and content dynamically. This powerful feature, when misused or handled insecurely, leads to **DOM-based vulnerabilities**.

These vulnerabilities occur when **attacker-controlled data (source)** is passed into a **dangerous function or object (sink)** without proper validation or sanitization.

## Taint-Flow Vulnerabilities

Taint-flow vulnerabilities in the DOM stem from unsafe handling of data that flows from **untrusted sources** to **sensitive sinks**.

### What is a Source?

A **source** is any JavaScript property or object that receives data, typically user-controlled. If an attacker can influence the content of a source, and the application fails to handle it safely, it can be abused.

**Common Sources Include:**

* `location.search` – Query string parameters
* `location.hash` – URL fragment identifier
* `document.referrer` – Referring page
* `document.cookie` – User’s cookies
* `window.name` – Window metadata
* `postMessage` – Web messages from other origins

These values can often be manipulated directly by an attacker to inject payloads.

---

### What is a Sink?

A **sink** is a function or property that executes or renders data in a way that can be dangerous if the data is not properly sanitized.

**Examples of Dangerous Sinks:**

* `eval()` – Executes arbitrary JavaScript code
* `document.write()` – Injects HTML into the page
* `element.innerHTML` – Renders raw HTML (possible script injection)
* `element.setAttribute()` – Sets tag attributes, which may be scriptable (e.g., `onerror`, `href`)
* `location.href`, `window.location` – Can cause redirects
* `setTimeout()`/`setInterval()` – Can execute strings as code

## DOM Vulnerabilities: Source to Sink

> A DOM-based vulnerability arises when data from a source flows into a sink without validation or sanitization, enabling the attacker to control the sink’s behavior.

Example:

```js
// Vulnerable code
let name = location.search.slice(6);  // source
document.body.innerHTML = "<h1>" + name + "</h1>"; // sink
```

If an attacker accesses the page with `?name=<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`, the payload gets rendered and executed.
