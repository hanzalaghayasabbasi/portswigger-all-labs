# Web Cache Poisoning

## What is Web Cache Poisoning?

Web cache poisoning is an advanced attack technique that allows an attacker to exploit caching behavior so that a harmful HTTP response is served to other users. The attack unfolds in two primary phases:

1. **Elicit a harmful response** from the origin server using manipulated input.
2. **Get that response cached** so that it's served to other users with equivalent cache keys.

This technique can lead to serious exploits such as:

* Cross-site scripting (XSS)
* Open redirects
* Injection of malicious JavaScript

## Understanding Web Cache Behavior

### Types of Caches:

* **Browser Cache** (Local)
* **DNS Cache** (DNS Level)
* **Application Cache** (Server-side)

Web cache poisoning targets **application-level caches**, not browser or DNS caches.

### How Does a Web Cache Work?

A web cache stores server responses to reduce the load and latency of web applications. When a request is made:

* If it's a **cache hit**, the response is served from the cache.
* If it's a **cache miss**, the origin server responds and the cache may store it for future requests.

### Cache Keys

Cache keys determine which responses get reused. They usually include:

* URL path
* Host header
* Optional: query parameters, content type, etc.

**Unkeyed inputs** are request components not included in the cache key. These become the attackerâ€™s point of exploitation.

## Impact of Cache Poisoning

The severity depends on:

1. **What payload is cached**: The more dangerous the payload (e.g. XSS), the higher the impact.
2. **Popularity of the page**: A poisoned cache on a high-traffic page amplifies reach.

Even short-lived caches can be re-poisoned continuously, making the effect persistent.

## How to Construct a Web Cache Poisoning Attack

### 1. Identify Unkeyed Inputs

These are often headers like:

* `X-Forwarded-Host`
* `X-Forwarded-For`
* `User-Agent`

Use tools like **Burp Suite Param Miner**:

* Right-click a request > Guess headers
* Review the output tab for interesting behavior

> **Caution:** Use cache busters to avoid poisoning real user traffic during tests.

### 2. Elicit a Harmful Response

Once you find an unkeyed input:

* Inject payloads and analyze reflection or response behavior
* Look for improper sanitization or dynamic generation from headers

### 3. Get the Response Cached

Trigger conditions that make the response cacheable:

* `Cache-Control: public`
* Use static-like routes or file extensions
* Adjust content-type, status code, etc.

## Exploiting Web Cache Poisoning

### Exploiting Cache Design Flaws

#### Reflected XSS via Unkeyed Headers

```http
GET /en?region=uk HTTP/1.1
Host: innocent-website.com
X-Forwarded-Host: a."><script>alert(1)</script>
```

Response:

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="https://a."><script>alert(1)</script>/cms/social.png" />
```

If cached, this payload is delivered to all users.

---

### Exploiting Unsafe Resource Imports

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: innocent-website.com
X-Forwarded-Host: evil-user.net
```

Response:

```html
<script src="https://evil-user.net/static/analytics.js"></script>
```

This results in arbitrary JS execution for every user who receives the cached page.

## Summary

Web cache poisoning is a powerful vulnerability with a wide range of potential impacts. By understanding caching behavior, identifying unkeyed inputs, and crafting harmful yet cacheable responses, attackers can hijack legitimate traffic and distribute malicious content at scale.

**Always test responsibly with cache busters.**
