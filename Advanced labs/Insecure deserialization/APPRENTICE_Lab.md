## Labs Covered

This write-up focuses on the following **APPRENTICE-level lab** from the PortSwigger Web Security Academy related to **Insecure Deserialization**:

**Modifying serialized objects**  
This lab demonstrates how attackers can tamper with serialized data structures to manipulate application logic and potentially gain unauthorized access.

### LAB 1 - Modifying serialized objects

### Lab Description

### Solution

Before login I Inspect cookie but there is no value is set for it:

After I  have login I get cookies

Now I have copy he cookie first url decode it and then  **base64** decode it and get the  serialized data from cookie.

Now I change 0 **to** 1,So in boolean 0 false and 1 true and base64 encode the text

Now copy above base **64** and paste it in cookie then send request that tell us you have to navigate to `/admin` to goto admin panel

Navigate to **admin panel**.Now to solve lab we have to delete carlos we have delete carlos and lab is solved

Follow redirection and now we can see no carlos user in reponse and lab is solved
