### Solution

Implicit Grant Type is used as OAuth Grant Type in Lab. The difference of the Implicit Grant Type is that the access token is sent immediately after the user approves. It is less reliable because all communication is routed through the browser.

First when I clicked on my account ,it Is telling me it is redirecting me to social media account.

The above interception request gives us  **GET /auth** request. This request defines the client applicationâ€™s access permissions to the OAuth service. There are many parameters and they are all used in different definitions.

**Note**:We can read above  implict or Authorized code section to know what is happening in the request
